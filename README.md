# Note App Frontend Test (React)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### Candidate Details

Name: Dom I.K Ubah.

#### Site URL

https://note-app-beta-one.vercel.app

#### Methodology
- **Visual Design:**
Wrote some plain CSS making use of [BEM](https://getbem.com/) standards
However I still placed all styles in one page following [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app) configs methods

- **Data Flow Design:**
Normally I would break functions and state into various context and connect components with hooks in a larger app but to keep it simple I have chosen not to do this

### Available Components

- Form Button
- Form Input
- No Note
- Note Form
- Note Item
- Note Layout

### Available Pages

- App Page

### Data Pages

All static data can be found in the data.ts page in the `src/data` folder

### Available Interfaces (types)

All interfaces are in the `src/interfaces` folder

- Note

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

(I wrote some tests in the App.tsx:)

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
